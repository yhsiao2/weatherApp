##About
This is a project about creating a weather app by pulling data from an API. Which openweathermap.org was used.

##Usage
Since the web app requires an API key to work, please input your own API key from openweathermap.org
Step 1: create a config.js file in the same directory as your index.html
step 2: paste the following code into config.js

const weatherApiKey='APIKEY';
export {weatherApiKey};

step 3: Change "APIKEY" into your own api key that you acquired from openweathermap.org.
Done!
